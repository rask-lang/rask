# Reference

Detailed technical documentation for Rask.

## For Users vs Implementers

This book provides high-level user-facing documentation. For formal specifications and implementation details, see:

- [Formal Specifications](specs-link.md) - Detailed specs in `specs/` folder

## Coming Soon

Once the language stabilizes:

- Generated API documentation
- Standard library reference
- Compiler command-line reference
- Error code index

## Current Status

Rask is in the design phase. The formal specifications are actively being developed and are the canonical source of truth for the language.

For now, refer to:
- [Formal Specifications](specs-link.md) for detailed language semantics
- [Language Guide](../guide/README.md) for high-level concepts
- [Examples](../examples/README.md) for practical code
