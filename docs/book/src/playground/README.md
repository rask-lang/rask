# Playground

An interactive WASM-based playground for trying Rask in your browser is planned.

For now, please [build and run locally](../getting-started/installation.md).

## Coming Soon

The playground will provide:
- Online editor with syntax highlighting
- Instant execution (no setup required)
- Shareable code snippets
- Example programs to explore
- Quick experimentation without installation

## Technical Approach

The playground will compile the Rask interpreter to WebAssembly, allowing code execution directly in your browser without server-side processing.

## Timeline

The playground will be developed after:
1. Language design stabilizes
2. Core interpreter is feature-complete
3. WASM compilation support is added

## Try Rask Now

While waiting for the playground:
1. [Install Rask locally](../getting-started/installation.md)
2. Run the [examples](../examples/README.md)
3. Write your own programs

## Stay Updated

Follow development:
