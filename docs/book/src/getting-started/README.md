# Getting Started

Welcome to Rask! This section will help you get started with the language.

> **Note:** Rask is in early development. Currently only the interpreter is available (no compiler yet).

## What You'll Learn

- [Installation](installation.md) - Build Rask from source
- [Your First Program](first-program.md) - Hello world and basic syntax

## Status

Rask is in the design phase with a working interpreter. Three of the five litmus test programs run:
- Grep clone ✓
- Game loop ✓
- Text editor ✓
- HTTP server (blocked on network I/O)
- Embedded sensor (blocked on SIMD)

## Next Steps

After completing this section, continue to the [Language Guide](../guide/README.md) to learn core concepts.
