# Language Guide

This guide covers the essential features of Rask.

> **Note:** Rask is in active design. This guide covers what's currently implemented in the interpreter. For detailed specifications, see the [Formal Specifications](../reference/specs-link.md).

## Contents

- [Basic Syntax](basic-syntax.md) - Variables, functions, control flow
- [Ownership and Memory](ownership.md) - Single ownership, moves, borrows
- [Collections and Handles](collections.md) - Vec, Map, Pool
- [Error Handling](error-handling.md) - Result types, try operator
- [Concurrency](concurrency.md) - Tasks, threads, channels

## Learning Path

1. Start with [Basic Syntax](basic-syntax.md) to understand the fundamentals
2. Learn [Ownership](ownership.md) - this is the key insight that makes Rask work
3. Explore [Collections and Handles](collections.md) for working with data structures
4. Master [Error Handling](error-handling.md) for robust programs
5. Discover [Concurrency](concurrency.md) for parallel execution

## Examples

Prefer learning by example? See the [Examples section](../examples/README.md) for complete working programs.
