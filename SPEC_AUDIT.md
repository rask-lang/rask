# Compiler vs Spec Audit

Systematic comparison of what the specs require vs what the compiler implements (both interpreter and codegen). Organized by severity.

---

## Critical Gaps (spec features with zero implementation)

### 1. ~~`ensure` cleanup — does nothing (EN1–EN7)~~ PARTIALLY FIXED

**Interpreter:** Fully working. `exec_stmts()` collects ensures and runs them in LIFO order on any block exit (normal, error, return). Consumption cancellation (C1) tracked via `ensure_receiver_consumed()`. Error handling (ER1–ER5) implemented with `else` handler support.

**MIR/Codegen:** Ensure bodies now lower into cleanup blocks. `CleanupReturn` terminators at `return`, `try` error, and implicit function exit chain through cleanup blocks in LIFO order. Inliner converts `CleanupReturn` to inline cleanup + goto when functions are inlined.

Working:
- LIFO cleanup on function exit (EN2) ✓
- Cleanup on `return` (EX2) ✓
- Cleanup on `try` error propagation (EX3) ✓
- Cleanup on implicit function exit (EX1) ✓
- Cleanup on `break`/`continue` (EX4) ✓
- Per-iteration cleanup in loops (EN7) ✓
- Multiple ensures with correct LIFO ordering ✓
- Function inlining preserves cleanup semantics ✓
- Loop-scoped ensures: `ensure_depth` on LoopContext, inline cleanup at break/continue/iteration-end, stack truncated after loop ✓

- `else` handler error routing (ER2): cleanup blocks form proper sub-CFGs with Branch terminators. Codegen processes full cleanup sub-CFGs. Inliner redirects Unreachable sentinels to merge blocks ✓
- Error type inferred from body call's Result type for handler binding ✓

Remaining:
- No explicit consumption cancellation (C1/C2) in codegen — needs C runtime resource tracker (interpreter has it)
- Linear resource consumption commitment (L1–L3) — ownership checker tracks it, codegen doesn't enforce

### 2. `@binary` structs — completely unimplemented (type.binary B1–G4)

Zero parser support, zero codegen, zero stdlib. The entire binary struct feature:
- No `@binary` attribute recognition
- No bit-width field specifiers (`version: 4`, `u16be`, `u16le`)
- No generated `.parse()` / `.build()` methods
- No compile-time validation of layouts

**Impact:** Binary protocol parsing (TCP headers, file formats, wire protocols) has no path.

### 3. ~~Error origin tracking — not implemented (ER15, ER16)~~ FIXED

**Interpreter:** `Value::Enum` carries `origin: Option<Arc<str>>`. `try` sets origin to `"file.rk:line"` at first propagation only (first-wins per ER15). `.origin()` universal method — enums return stored origin, other types return `"<no origin>"`. SourceInfo (file name + LineMap) passed from CLI.

**Codegen:** Result layout changed to `[tag:8][origin_file:8][origin_line:8][payload]` (+16 bytes per Result). MIR `lower_try` constructs full Result.Err with origin line from LineMap on err path; conditional branch preserves source origin if already set (first-propagation semantics). `.origin()` calls `rask_result_origin` C runtime helper. `rask_set_origin_file()` called at start of `rask_main` to register the source file name — codegen now returns `"file.rk:line"` matching interpreter output.

### 4. `Cell<T>` type — doesn't exist (CE1–CE6)

Spec defines `Cell<T>` as a heap-allocated single-value container with `with`-based access. Not in stdlib stubs, not in builtins, not in runtime.

**Impact:** No way to share a mutable value across closures without Pool+Handle ceremony.

### 5. ~~`discard` statement — not implemented (D1–D3)~~ FIXED

Full pipeline: lexer → parser → AST → type checker → ownership checker → interpreter → MIR → formatter. D1 (use-after-discard error), D2 (Copy type warning), D3 (@resource compile error) all enforced.

### 6. `comptime for` + field reflection — not implemented (CT48–CT54)

- `comptime for` not recognized as distinct from regular `for`
- No loop unrolling at compile time
- No `value.(comptime_expr)` dynamic field access syntax
- No `reflect.fields<T>()` or `reflect.variants<T>()` API

**Impact:** Encoding/decoding spec (which relies on `comptime for` over struct fields) is blocked. Serialization patterns don't work.

### 7. C header auto-parsing — not implemented (CI1)

`import c "header.h"` syntax doesn't parse. Only manual `extern "C"` bindings work.

**Impact:** C interop requires manual binding declarations for every function.

---

## Major Gaps (partially implemented, key behaviors missing)

### 8. `for mutate` iteration — partially enforced (LP11–LP16)

Parser accepts `for mutate item in vec { ... }`. Ownership checker now enforces:
- ~~No structural mutation check inside body (LP14 — `vec.push()` during `for mutate` not rejected)~~ FIXED — push/pop/insert/remove/clear/drain rejected on iterated collection
- ~~No enforcement that `item` can't be passed to `take` parameters (LP16)~~ FIXED — `own item` to take params rejected with clear error
- MIR doesn't generate different access patterns for mutable vs immutable iteration (LP11–LP13 in-place mutation codegen still pending)

### 9. Pool API — missing several spec-required features

Missing from both interp and codegen:
- `pool.try_insert(x)` returning `Result<Handle<T>, InsertError<T>>` (PL8)
- `WeakHandle<T>` with `.valid()` and `.upgrade()` (weak handles spec)
- `pool.snapshot()` for concurrent read/write (PL9)
- `pool.drain()` and `pool.entries()` iterators
- Performance escape hatches: `pool.with_valid()`, `pool.get_unchecked()`
- `Pool<@resource>` runtime panic when non-empty at scope exit (R5)

### 10. Concurrency — missing Phase A surface area (PARTIALLY FIXED)

~~`try_send()` on channels~~ FIXED — non-blocking send returns "channel full" or "channel closed" error. ~~`close()` on Sender/Receiver~~ FIXED — replaces internal handle to disconnect the channel. ~~`Shared<T>.try_read()` / `.try_write()`~~ FIXED — non-blocking closure-based access returns `Option<R>`, `try_write` writes back like regular write. All three implemented in interpreter with type checker and registry support.

Remaining Phase A gaps:

| Missing | Spec rule |
|---------|-----------|
| `join_all(handles)` | M1 |
| `select_first(handles)` | M2 |
| `TaskGroup<T>` struct + methods | M3 |
| `cancelled()` runtime check | CN1 |
| `Timer.after(duration)` | Channels |
| `ensure` cleanup on cancellation | CN2 |

### 11. ~~Disjoint field borrowing — unclear enforcement (F1–F4)~~ PARTIALLY FIXED

F1–F3 (direct field borrows) fully implemented: `extract_root_and_fields()`, `ActiveBorrow.projection`, `overlaps()` all work — disjoint field borrows coexist correctly. F4 (closure field-level captures) now implemented: `collect_free_vars` tracks field projections so closures capturing `state.score` register a field-level borrow, not a whole-object borrow on `state`. Closure captures of disjoint fields no longer conflict.

### 12. ~~`@unique` move-only types — enforcement unclear (U1–U4)~~ FIXED

`is_unique` flag on TypeDef::Struct, parsed from `@unique` attribute. Ownership checker's `is_copy()` returns false for unique types. `MoveReason::Unique` wired through diagnostics. U4 transitive propagation via fixed-point iteration in `propagate_uniqueness()` — structs containing unique fields are automatically marked unique.

### 13. ~~Scope-limited closures — escape not detected (SL1–SL2)~~ FIXED

Closures capturing non-Copy `const` bindings (block-scoped borrows) are now scope-limited. Ownership checker tracks borrow bindings and closure scope limits. Two escape paths detected: (1) `return f` where `f` is scope-limited → E0813 error; (2) assigning scope-limited closure to outer-scope variable → E0813 at block exit. Valid in-scope use (calling the closure, passing it to functions) works fine.

### 14. ~~`private` field enforcement — not type-checked (V5)~~ FIXED

Private fields now checked in struct literals and field access. Extend-block context carried through HasField constraints.

---

## Minor Gaps (edge cases, polish, non-critical paths)

### 15. ~~Single-element tuple `(T,)` — not parsed (TU4)~~ FIXED

Parser now distinguishes `(T)` (parenthesized) from `(T,)` (single-element tuple) for both expressions and types.

### 16. ~~Labeled break with value — MIR doesn't allocate result slots (CF25)~~ FIXED

Loop expressions now allocate `result_local` so `break value` stores correctly. Works for both statement and expression loops.

### 17. ~~Cyclic type alias detection — silent (T6)~~ FIXED

Cycle detection at registration time with clear error showing the cycle path.

### 18. ~~Enum `.discriminant()` builtin — not exposed (E9)~~ FIXED

`.discriminant()` method on enum values returns `u16` variant index. Type checker, interpreter, and MIR lowering all support it.

### 19. ~~`.variants()` error on payload enums — not checked (E10)~~ ALREADY FIXED

Both type checker and interpreter reject `.variants()` on enums with payload fields. Was implemented before audit.

### 20. ~~Iterator trait — not user-visible (type.iterators)~~ FIXED

`Iterator` registered as a builtin trait in `get_builtin_trait_methods` with `next(mutate self) -> Item?`. Parser now supports generic trait bounds (`T: Iterator<i64>`) with `>>` splitting for nested generics. Trait lookup strips generic args so `Iterator<i64>` resolves to the `Iterator` trait definition. Users can write `func consume<T: Iterator<string>>(iter: T)` and have bounds checked.

### 21. ~~Error auto-delegation for `@message` wrapper variants (ER25)~~ FIXED

Desugar now only auto-delegates for single-field variants whose type name ends with "Error" (ER25). Variants with fields but no `@message` and no auto-delegatable payload trigger an ER26 coverage error. Pipeline reports desugar errors before proceeding.

### 22. ~~Step range validation (SP1–SP3)~~ FIXED

SP3 (zero step) produces a compile error. SP1/SP2 (direction mismatch) now produce compile-time warnings when start, end, and step are all integer literals — e.g., `(10..0).step(2)` warns that the positive step on a descending range will produce zero iterations. Handles desugared negative literals (`-1` → `(1).neg()`).

### 23. ~~Comptime safety limits (CT27–CT35)~~ FIXED

Default backwards branch quota set to 1,000 (CT35, was incorrectly 10,000). Call depth tracking added with 256-frame limit (CT29) — stack overflow detected separately from branch quota with clear error. `@comptime_quota(N)` attribute override not yet implemented.

### 24. Context clause auto-resolution — opaque (CC1–CC10)

`using` clauses parsed, but the hidden parameter threading mechanism for auto-resolution isn't clearly wired through all passes.

### 25. Inline expression access for sync primitives (E5)

`Shared<T>.read()` and `.lock()` chains should be expression-scoped. Borrow checker doesn't enforce this boundary.

---

## Codegen-Specific Gaps

### 26. SIMD — stub only

`f32x8`/`i32x4` defined in MirType but passed as pointers like structs. No actual SIMD instructions generated. Interpreter simulates element-wise.

### 27. Debug info — partial DWARF

Source locations tracked but DWARF generation is minimal. Not fully integrated.

### 28. Single target — x86-64 only

No ARM, no WASM codegen paths. Cranelift supports them, but the compiler doesn't configure for anything else.

---

## Stdlib Gaps (interp has more coverage than codegen)

### Completely missing subsystems (0% implemented)

**Encoding (std.encoding)** — No stub file. No `Encode`/`Decode` traits, no auto-derive, no field annotations (`@rename`, `@skip`, `@default`, `@tag`). Blocked on `comptime for` + reflection (gap #6 above).

**Formatting (std.fmt)** — No stub file. No `format(template, ...args)` with compile-time checking, no format specifiers (`{:?}`, `{:x}`, `{:>10}`, `{:.3}`), no `Displayable`/`Debug` traits, no named interpolation in `println()`. Current state: basic `print()`/`println()` with string args only.

**Testing (std.testing)** — No stub file. No `test` block execution infrastructure, no `check` (soft assert, A2), no `skip()`/`expect_fail()` (T12–T13), no `benchmark` blocks (B1–B2), no doc test extraction (T14–T15), no subtests (T10), no parallel execution (T7), no seeded random (T8).

### Significantly incomplete (20–50% implemented)

**I/O (std.io ~20%)** — No `Reader`/`Writer` traits. No `BufReader`/`BufWriter`. No `Stdin`/`Stdout`/`Stderr` as linear resources. No `Buffer` type. No `io.copy()`. File has `read_all()` but doesn't formally implement traits.

**Strings (std.strings ~40%)** — Core string type works, but missing: `string_builder` type, `string_view` type (lightweight indices), `StringPool` type, `cstring` type and `c"literal"` syntax, `from_utf8()` validation, `char_count()`, `is_ascii()` with caching.

**OS (std.os ~50%)** — Env/args/exit/platform work. Missing: `Command` builder for subprocess spawning, `Process` as `@resource` with `wait()`/`kill_and_wait()`, `Signal` enum, `os.on_signal()` handler, `os.set_env()`/`os.remove_env()`.

### Mostly complete with notable gaps (60–85%)

**Collections (std.collections ~85%)** — Core Vec/Map/Pool work. Missing: `try_push()`/`try_insert()` error variants, `AllocError` enum, `vec.with()` block syntax, `vec.modify_many()`, `SliceDescriptor<T>` type, `vec.shrink_to_fit()`.

**Time (std.time ~75%)** — `Duration` and `Instant` work. Missing: `SystemTime` type entirely (only `Instant` exists), `Duration.from_secs_f64()`, arithmetic operators on Duration.

**FS (std.fs ~75%)** — Read/write/append/list work. Missing: `OpenOptions` builder pattern, `Metadata` struct (`is_file`, `is_dir`, `size`, `modified`), `DirEntry` struct, `File` doesn't implement Reader/Writer traits.

**Net (std.net ~70%)** — TCP listener/connection work. Missing: `UdpSocket` entirely, `net.resolve()` DNS resolution.

**HTTP (std.http ~65%)** — Basic server/client work. Missing: `Request.query_param()`/`query_params()`, `HttpClient` builder, `Responder` as `@resource` linear handle, `http.listen_and_serve()`.

**JSON (std.json ~70%)** — Parse/stringify work. Missing: typed `encode()`/`decode()` depends on missing Encode/Decode traits, field annotations depend on encoding spec.

**CLI (std.cli ~60%)** — Quick API works. Missing: `cli.Parser` builder pattern, auto-generated `--help`/`--version`, `CliError` enum.

### Bits (std.bits)

Binary parsing utilities specified but not implemented (tied to `@binary` gap above).

---

## What's Well-Implemented

For balance — these areas are solid:

- **Ownership/move semantics** (O1–O4): Use-after-move detection works
- **Basic borrowing** (A1–A3): Read/exclusive conflicts caught
- **Parameter modes** (PM1–PM3): borrow/mutate/take all work
- **Traits + trait objects** (TR1–TR16): Full vtable dispatch, implicit coercion
- **Enums + pattern matching** (E1–E8, PM1–PM6): Exhaustiveness, guards, destructuring
- **Optionals** (`T?`): Full OPT1–OPT13 compliance
- **Error types** (`T or E`): ER1–ER14 mostly working, `try`/`try...else`, `@message`
- **Generics + monomorphization**: G1–G7, full specialization pipeline
- **Closures**: Stack/heap allocation, captures, nested closures
- **String SSO + RC**: Runtime is sophisticated (16-byte SSO, refcount elision for statics)
- **Collections**: Vec, Map, Pool core operations all work
- **Concurrency basics**: spawn/join/detach, channels, Shared<T>, Mutex, atomics
- **JSON**: Full parse/stringify/encode/decode
- **HTTP/TCP**: Server + client both work
- **File I/O**: Read, write, append, directory listing
