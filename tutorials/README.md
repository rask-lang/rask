# Rask Tutorials

The [learn-rask](learn-rask/) track teaches Rask from scratch, assuming you know Python.
19 lessons covering variables through concurrency and compile-time computation.
Aviation-themed — physics sims, flight trackers, and a final flight dynamics project.

See [learn-rask/00_setup.md](learn-rask/00_setup.md) to get started.
