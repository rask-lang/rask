# Level 5 — Integration

Full programs. Does everything hold together?

## Challenges

1. [Log Analyzer](log-analyzer.md) — file I/O + string parsing + data structures
2. [Chat Room](chat-room.md) — concurrency + shared state + data modeling

## What You Need

Everything from the previous levels. These challenges combine concepts — no new reference
material here. If you get stuck, check the level README for the relevant topic:

- Variables, control flow, collections → [Level 1](../01-core-feel/)
- Ownership, errors, file I/O → [Level 2](../02-ownership-errors/)
- Threads, channels, shared state → [Level 3](../03-concurrency/)
- Enums, generics, traits → [Level 4](../04-data-modeling/)
